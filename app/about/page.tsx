              <p>I started Chivora because data migration kept being the thing that went wrong.</p>
              <p>
                Across <TodoChip>7</TodoChip> years working on ERP
                transformation programmes — including implementations
                moving organisations from Microsoft Dynamics NAV and SAP
                into Dynamics 365 — I watched the same failure play out
                repeatedly. The functional design would be solid. The
                configuration would be done. The training would be
                delivered. And then, in the final weeks before go-live, the
                data would surface problems that should have been found in
                month two.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason was always the same: nobody had owned data
                migration as a discipline. It had been distributed across
                people with other priorities, no dedicated tooling, and no
                structured methodology. It was treated as something that
                would &quot;just happen&quot; alongside everything else —
                and it didn&apos;t.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have been part of <TodoChip>6</TodoChip> migration
                projects across that period, working across General Ledger,
                Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Inventory, Fixed
                Assets, Customers, and Vendors — and across source systems
                including SAP, Microsoft Dynamics NAV, SAGE, BPCS, IFS, and
                Access Dimensions. I know where the problems hide in each of
                those systems because I have found them, documented them,
                and fixed them under real delivery pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chivora exists to provide what those programmes were
                missing: a single, accountable specialist who owns data
                migration from discovery through to post-go-live sign-off,
                with a methodology built from real delivery experience
                rather than generic best practice.

                Chivora takes on a small number of engagements at a time —
                by design. Every client gets my direct involvement from the
                first discovery conversation through to post-go-live
                sign-off. There are no account managers, no junior
                handoffs, and no situations where the person who scoped the
                work is not the person delivering it.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-[1.7] text-ink-soft">
                I work remotely as standard, with on-site attendance for key
                workshops, mock migration reviews, and cutover. I am based
                in the UK and available for programmes across the UK and,
                where the engagement is primarily remote, internationally.

              On most implementations, data migration is handed to a
              functional consultant to run alongside their configuration
              work — squeezed into whatever time is left between workshops.
              It usually surfaces as a problem for the first time at the
              first mock migration, when balances don&apos;t reconcile and
              nobody on the programme owns the fix.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-justify text-[var(--text-body)] leading-[1.7] text-ink-soft">
              We exist because that pattern is predictable and avoidable.
              Treating data migration as its own workstream, with a
              dedicated team and a repeatable methodology, is the difference
              between a go-live that slips and one that doesn&apos;t.
